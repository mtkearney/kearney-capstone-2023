## Analysis
To answer the first research question, how RAPM fares as a predictor of regular season wins or as a predictor of player accolades, data needs to be pulled in about how teams and players perform in the regular season. Because the On/Off split data holds team wins, the sum of team wins was pulled from that data, while player accolade data was pulled from basketball-reference.com and manually compiled. 


```{r}
#player wins while on over three year span - not needed
RAPMoneyear = allRAPM %>% filter(RAPM_Type == 'oneYear') %>% mutate(year = str_sub(season, start= -2)) %>% select(playerId, RAPM, year) %>% rename(RAPM_one = RAPM)
RAPMthreeyear = allRAPM %>% filter(RAPM_Type == 'threeYear') %>% mutate(year = str_sub(season, start= -2)) %>% select(playerId, RAPM, year) %>% rename(RAPM_three = RAPM)
RAPMfiveyear = allRAPM %>% filter(RAPM_Type == 'fiveYear')  %>% mutate(year = str_sub(season, start= -2)) %>% select(playerId, RAPM, year)%>% rename(RAPM_five = RAPM) 
RAPMwins = left_join(RAPMoneyear, RAPMthreeyear, by = c("playerId", "year"))
RAPMwins = left_join(RAPMwins, RAPMfiveyear, by = c("playerId", "year"))
RAPMwins = left_join(RAPMwins, distinct(allRAPM %>% select(playerId, playerName)), by = c("playerId"))
RAPMwins = left_join(RAPMwins, (Accolades %>% mutate(year = str_sub(Season, start= -2)) ) , by = c("playerId" = 'playerID', "year"))
write.csv(RAPMwins, '/Users/matthewkearney/RAPMwins.csv')

years = c('2021-22', '2020-21', '2019-20')
playerTeams = distinct(allOnOff %>% filter(COURT_STATUS == 'On') %>% select(VS_PLAYER_ID, VS_PLAYER_NAME, TEAM_ABBREVIATION, Season, W))
playerSeasons = playerTeams %>% filter(Season %in% years) %>% group_by(VS_PLAYER_ID, VS_PLAYER_NAME)  
playerSeasons = left_join(playerSeasons, (playerTeams %>% filter(Season %in% years) %>% group_by(VS_PLAYER_ID, VS_PLAYER_NAME) %>% count(VS_PLAYER_NAME) %>% rename(teams = n)) %>% mutate(season = '2019-22') )

threeYearWins = bind_rows(threeYearWins, playerSeasons)
threeYearWins %>% arrange(-WinsWhenOn)




x = left_join(splits, (allRAPM), by = c('VS_PLAYER_ID' = 'playerId', 'TEAM_ABBREVIATION' = 'teamName', 'Season' = 'season'))
x = drop_na(x)

teamWins = allOnOff %>% filter(COURT_STATUS == 'Off')  %>% group_by(TEAM_ABBREVIATION, Season) %>% summarise(teamWins = max(W)) %>% arrange(Season, -teamWins)
x = x %>% group_by(Season, TEAM_ABBREVIATION) %>% summarise(RAPM = mean(RAPM))
teamWins = left_join(x, teamWins)
teamWins %>% group_by(Season) %>% count(Season)
write.csv(teamWins, '/Users/matthewkearney/teamWins.csv')
write.csv(winShareCombined, '/Users/matthewkearney/teamWins.csv')

allOnOff %>% filter() %>% group_by(Season) %>% count(Season)

allOnOff %>% filter(COURT_STATUS == 'On') %>% summarise(mean(MIN))
```
The resulting dataframe contains the one, three, and five year RAPM data for each qualifying NBA player who played over 1000 minutes that season. Below contains a plot to show the simple linear regression for team wins over one year RAPMs, as the values for three and five year RAPMs do not account for the teams the player played on, making it impossible to accurately display the average RAPM for a team.

```{r}
x = lm(RAPM ~ teamWins, data = teamWins)

plot(teamWins$teamWins, teamWins$RAPM) 
summary(x)
```


```{r}
ctrl <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)

#fit a regression model and use k-fold CV to evaluate performance
model <- train(RAPM_three ~ WS, data = (winShareCombined), method = 'lm', trControl = ctrl)

#view summary of k-fold CV               
print(model)
```
To test how player wins and accolades are measured by RAPM, two variables will be brought in: player accolades, like MVP, and Win Shares, which is an estimate of how many wins a player produced.
```{r}

x = lm(weighted_rank ~ RAPM_one, data = (RAPMwins%>% filter(weighted_rank>0)))

plot(RAPMwins$RAPM_one, RAPMwins$weighted_rank) 
abline(x)
summary(x)
```
Obviously, the small sample size of players who received a vote for MVP, DPOY, or a All-NBA team makes it hard to draw conclusions about how RAPM performs as a measure of player performance when it comes to predicting accolades. However, the statistic "Win Shares" is an attempt to credit wins to a specific player. Below shows the correlation of RAPM to a player's win shares, over a one, three, and five year period.

```{r}
winShareCombined = left_join((winShares %>% mutate(year = str_sub(Season, start= -2)) ), (RAPMwins %>% select(RAPM_one, RAPM_three, RAPM_five, playerId, year)), by = c("VS_PLAYER_ID" = "playerId", 'year' = 'year'))
x = lm(WS~RAPM_one, data = winShareCombined)
plot(winShareCombined$RAPM_one, winShareCombined$WS)
abline(x)
summary(x)
```
